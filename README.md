I created a personal website for my circus art. Its a simple one-page design and contains a modal gallery utilizing JavaScript. I look forward to adding more functionality to this site as I learn more.

### [Pizza Project](https://github.com/KMitzner9/Javascript_Projects/tree/master/Javascript/Pizza_Project)
I created an online order form that can be used to order a pizza. The form takes input about the size and toppings and produces a receipt with the requested pizzas and price.

### [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/KMitzner9/Javascript_Projects/tree/master/Javascript/TicTacToe)
I created a custom Tic-Tac-Toe game with annoying cat noises, mostly to freak out your pets, but also to gain a better understanding of how JavaScript can be used to create a program or game.

### [Calculator](https://github.com/KMitzner9/Javascript_Projects/tree/master/Javascript/Calculator)
